<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My JRNL</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- CHANGEME: Use your own URL here -->
    <jrnl src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/abcdef1234/jrnl.txt?dl=0" />
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/jrnl-render/dist/jrnl-render.standalone.min.js"></script>
  </body>

jrnl is a simple journal application for your command line. Journals are stored as human readable plain text files - you can put them into a Dropbox folder for instant syncing and you can be assured that your journal will still be readable in 2050, when all your fancy iPad journal applications will long be forgotten.
